On this page I would like to share some bigger projects that I have been working on. Projects are divided into categories, so the next time you visit the site it can be easier to find ;)

### Github

* __[Vertex Engine](https://github.com/Shot511/VertexEngine)__ - project of an engine to create simple games and grind my skills in C++ and OpenGL programming . For now, the project is focused on developing graphics parts.

* __[RapidGL](https://github.com/Shot511/RapidGL)__ - a framework for rapid OpenGL demos prototyping. This is the side project for testing new rendering techniques before implementing them in **Vertex Engine**.

* __[Vertextracer](https://github.com/Shot511/VertexTracer)__ - project of a simple raytracer that allows you to render quite realistically-looking scenes. It supports several light sources (directional, point), supports various materials (opaque, reflective refractive - Fresnel's equation). In addition, it has various antyaliasing methods (removing the jagged edges), and rendering is done using multithreading.

* __[strutil](https://github.com/shot511/strutil)__ - easy to use, header only C++ 11 std::string utility library.

### University projects

* __Master's thesis__ - _Complex scenes rendering optimization with OpenGL 4.5_ - covers utilization of OpenGL 4.5 AZDO features, including Compute Shaders in scenes that need huge computational power based on cloth simulation with self-collisions. More information can be found at this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0j4jdWAANaoY0NUMTdHSlZVRTg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-5gRsceh5u-okWhJuLzp-SQ). This is a RAR archive where I’ve included the thesis and a demo application showing the results.

* __Bachelor's thesis__ - _Dual quaternion based character animation_ - the purpose of this work was to compare the two methods of skinning-Linear Blend Skinning and Dual-Quaternion Skinning. You can find more information under [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0j4jdWAANaoYWoxZlZMdXcxNDg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-1xv97Qis28kpXUu9atcaqg). This is a RAR archive, where I’ve included the thesis and a demo application showing the results.

* __ZenGame__ - this game was awarded a special commendation for communication with the user during the 5th edition of [Polish Game Creation Challenge](http://gry.it.p.lodz.pl/) organized by Lodz University of Technology. In this project, I was responsible for creating the graphics engine and writing shaders with HLSL. I also took part in developing the plot, characters, locations. Everything was created with XNA framework and C#.
